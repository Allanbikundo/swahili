# Functions

The keyword for building functions is Shughuli.

```
  shughuli Salimu(jina){
    andika("Habari, " + jina)
  }

  Salimu("Wendo") //Call the function
```

Using the shughuli keyword allows you to build a function. To use said funtion later in the program, you call it by its name and pass in the required parameters.
